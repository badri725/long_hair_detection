## Long Hair Detection
Detecting size of the hair range between 20 and 30 if male with long hair predicted as female and female with short hair predicted as  a male
## To run the model
1. clone this repository
2. Run the [GUI.py](https://github.com/Vasantharish/long_hair_detection/blob/0cf884b0b2e2ab7158fc84c836d502351e0824e4/GUI.py)file
3. with options you can select images to test by choosing file or select custom images
4. click show selected button if you're selected custom images

## To run notebook
1. clone this repository
2. This project contains two notebooks one for age, gender classification another for hair classification.
3. For age gender classification download [UTK_dataset](https://github.com/Vasantharish/long_hair_detection/tree/3a252e9e7fb34a67f6002e1b4c278b56b2716d1b/UTKFace)dataset.
4. For hair classification download [hair_seperation](https://github.com/Vasantharish/long_hair_detection/tree/0cf884b0b2e2ab7158fc84c836d502351e0824e4/hair_seperation)dataset.
5. Run two notebooks[age-gender.ipynb](https://github.com/Vasantharish/long_hair_detection/blob/0cf884b0b2e2ab7158fc84c836d502351e0824e4/age-gender.ipynb) [binary-images](https://github.com/Vasantharish/long_hair_detection/blob/0cf884b0b2e2ab7158fc84c836d502351e0824e4/binary-images.ipynb) one after another after downloading the above mentioned datasets
6. To get two models which used for predicting images
